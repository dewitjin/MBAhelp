# MBAhelp

## Synopsis

This is the start of a platform to help business owners find solutions to their business problems.  In short, I am envisioning the problems to be solve by MBA business students.

## Code Example


A lot of the code in the project have been borrowed from class examples and labs.  In order for me to study codes effectively, I find it useful to actually build something fun with the code.  The code in this project is useful to start many other projects that need to read/write files, sort data, display menu, ask users for inputs and do something with the inputs.

## Motivation

This project exists because I am currently enrolled in the Management of Technology MBA program at SFU.  In order to leverage all the business knowledge I’ve learnt so far, I wanted to build something my MBA cohort and I could start playing with.  This project is only a slice of something I will build.  The end product will probably be written in web languages like html, css, JavaScript, JQuery and maybe knockout.js.  I will also build it by using Model–View–Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.  However, I’ve decided to write this particular project in C (programming language).

## Installation

In order to run this code, you need an integrated development environment like Visual Studio.  This program is created using Visual Studio 2015 and started with an empty Win32 Console Application.

## API Reference

None.

## Tests

No tests.
